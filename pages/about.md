**A P D X** is a place, where I get to share snapshots of life as I see it — moments, memories, and images that resonate with me most.

This page is my alternative to traditional social media — a personal, peaceful gallery where I can reflect on experiences that have shaped me.

I hope that as you explore, you’ll find beauty in these everyday moments and maybe even a reminder to cherish the ones that mean the most to you.
